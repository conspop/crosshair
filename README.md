## Description

Crosshair is a poker-based card game invented by a couple of my friends that I've adapted as a turn-based multiplayer web-app.

The game has a lobby where you can create or join existing games, supports playing multiple games at the same time and a leaderboard that ranks players using the ELO ranking system.

I am adding features continuously as Crosshair's users request them.

## Technologies Used

- Mongo DB
- Express
- React JS
- Node JS
- HTML/CSS/Javascript

## Screenshots

### Lobby

Users can create games and join games that other people have created.

### Games

Users games are listed and separated by completed games, your turn and their turn.

The gameplay is smooth and responsive.

## Next Steps

- I will implement a challenge system where a user can challenge a specific opponent rather than create a game that anyone can join
- I will implement some sort of weekly tournament system that matches users up with other users
- I will implement a chat into each game
- I am receiving feature requests from Crosshair's users to improve the game!
